  <p id="hello">In the criminal j
  ustice system, the people a
  
  re represented by two separate
  yet equally important groups. T
  he police who investigate crim
  e and the district attorneys wh
  o prosecute the offende
  rs. These are their stories.</p>

  
<p>Look for the Union L
abel when you are buying
 a coat, dress, or blous
 e. Remember, somewhere our u
 nion's sewing, our wages goin
 g to feed the kids, and run the 
 house. We work hard, but who's c
 omplaining. Thanks to the I.L.G.
 we're paying our way. S
 o always look for the Un
 ion Label. It means we're able t
 o make it in the U.S.A.!</p>

<p>I am Duncan Macleod, b

For centuries, we have waite

d for the time of the Gathering 
when the stroke of a sword and t
he fall of a head will release t
he
 power of the Quickening. In the
 end, there can be only one.</p>
