I'm Serere Jegede. 
I'm a budding Web Designer who loves learning things in a dynamic way. 
I believe I'm fun to  be around and I like to believe I'm smart. Actually, that was me being humble, I'm actually very smart.
I love intelligence as much as I am put off by its absence.
Oh,I am a critical thinker.
